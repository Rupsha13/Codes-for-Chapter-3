In this repository I attached the R codes I used for chapter 3 of my dissertation - Luck Vs. Skill in Mutual Fund Performance- Stock Return Skewness Matters. In this reserach I cleaned the stock database from CRSP, in order to measure the true alpha of an fund that has been created by just chance - I perform a dart throwing excercise where I create portfolios of stocks just by throwing darts. I calculate the 10,000 alphas of lucky portfolios to estimate the average true alpha for lucky portfolios.
